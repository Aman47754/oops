//abstraction means hidding the implementation details from the user and 
//exposing only the essential features to the user


//eg- pow(x,y)function ->we dont know the implamentation of this function , 
//it comes under math.h library and the library implementation is hidden from us

//similarly we hidden whole class implementation and we just have access to some features of the class,
//using that features we do our work
